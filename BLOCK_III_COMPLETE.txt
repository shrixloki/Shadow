Implemented Features:

API Gateway (Go):
✓ Secure REST endpoints for session management
✓ POST /api/v1/session/init - initialize cloud session
✓ POST /api/v1/session/sync - sync state/delta to cloud
✓ POST /api/v1/session/execute - trigger container execution
✓ GET /api/v1/session/list - list active sessions
✓ GET /api/v1/session/{id} - get session details
✓ WebSocket /ws/logs/{session_id} - real-time log streaming
✓ Token-based authentication with configurable headers
✓ CORS support for dashboard integration

Session Sync Worker:
✓ In-memory session store with TTL (72h default)
✓ Atomic writes and versioning to prevent race conditions
✓ Delta and snapshot sync support
✓ Background cleanup of expired sessions
✓ Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
✓ Batch sync operations for efficiency

Docker Runner:
✓ Ephemeral container creation from lightweight base images
✓ Session state mounting (read-only dependencies, writable ephemeral)
✓ Configurable test command execution
✓ Real-time log streaming via WebSocket
✓ Automatic container cleanup after execution
✓ Timeout handling and resource limits
✓ Concurrent execution management

CLI Cloud Commands:
✓ shadow offload - packages shadow state and executes in cloud
✓ shadow reclaim - downloads cloud session results to shadow
✓ shadow sync - syncs metadata/timeline to cloud vault
✓ Offline fallback when cloud unreachable
✓ Token-based authentication with local storage
✓ Comprehensive error handling and connectivity checks

Dashboard (Minimal):
✓ Real-time session list with status indicators
✓ Live log streaming for selected sessions
✓ Clean monospace interface matching Shadow aesthetic
✓ WebSocket connection management
✓ Session status visualization (running/completed/failed)
✓ Static HTML with embedded React (no build required)

Auth & Security:
✓ Token-based authentication for CLI→API
✓ Configurable auth headers and token validation
✓ Session payload size limits and validation
✓ TLS configuration support (disabled for local dev)
✓ No credentials stored in repository

Behavioral Compliance:
✓ No .md files created
✓ Minimal cloud surface (API + session + runner only)
✓ No multi-user collaboration features
✓ Preserves Block I & II contracts/interfaces
✓ Local-first principle maintained
✓ Sessions expire automatically (72h TTL)
✓ Containers always cleaned up after execution

Technical Implementation:
- Go-based API gateway with Gorilla Mux and WebSocket
- In-memory session store with concurrent access protection
- Docker API integration for container lifecycle management
- TypeScript CLI commands with axios HTTP client
- React dashboard with WebSocket real-time updates
- Comprehensive fallback implementations for offline operation

Build Process:
1. npm install (install Node.js dependencies including axios)
2. npm run build (compile TypeScript CLI)
3. cd cloud && chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh (build Go services)
4. ./cloud/bin/api_gateway (start API gateway)
5. cd dashboard/minimal && python3 -m http.server 3000 (serve dashboard)

Demo Flow:
1. shadow init → shadow start (local setup)
2. Create/edit files in .shadow/ workspace
3. shadow offload → uploads to cloud, triggers execution
4. View logs in dashboard at http://localhost:3000
5. shadow reclaim → downloads results back to shadow
6. shadow sync → syncs metadata to cloud vault

Validation Criteria Met:
✓ shadow offload triggers cloud session and docker execution
✓ Session metadata persisted and viewable in dashboard
✓ Containers cleaned up automatically after execution
✓ No .md files exist in repository
✓ CLI functions offline when cloud unreachable
✓ Logs stream to dashboard in real-time
✓ API accepts session init/sync/execute with JSON responses

Status: READY FOR BLOCK IV - ADVANCED FEATURES

All Block III requirements implemented with:
- Minimal secure bridge between local Shadow and ShrikCloud
- Session sync with ephemeral container runtime
- Basic dashboard API with real-time log streaming
- Token-based authentication and security
- CLI cloud commands (offload/reclaim/sync)
- Comprehensive offline fallback support
- Clean separation of concerns and minimal attack surface
