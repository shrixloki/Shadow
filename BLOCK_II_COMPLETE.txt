Implemented Features:

AST-Based Diff Tracking:
✓ Rust AST diff engine with TypeScript/JavaScript parser
✓ Structured diffs showing function/class/import changes
✓ WASM bindings for CLI integration
✓ Fallback implementations for development

Dependency Graph:
✓ Module-level dependency graph builder
✓ Impact analysis with cycle detection
✓ Risk level calculation (low/medium/high)
✓ Efficient querying for impacted modules

AI Observer:
✓ Python-based passive monitoring
✓ Pause detection (3s threshold)
✓ Heuristic-based impact analysis
✓ JSON output for structured suggestions
✓ Local-only operation with fallback

CLI Integration:
✓ shadow analyze command implemented
✓ AST diff computation via WASM
✓ Dependency graph analysis
✓ AI Observer integration with fallbacks
✓ Machine-parseable JSON output

Core Enhancements:
✓ Enhanced Rust engine with AST/dep graph support
✓ WASM bindings for all new functionality
✓ Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
✓ Unit tests for AST diff and dependency analysis

Behavioral Compliance:
✓ No .md files created
✓ Local-only operation (no network calls)
✓ Minimal dependencies (serde, rocksdb, wasm-bindgen)
✓ Logs to session.log only
✓ Preserves Block I architecture

Command Functionality:
- shadow init → Initialize shadow overlay (existing)
- shadow start → Enter Shadow Mode (existing)  
- shadow stop → Exit Shadow Mode (existing)
- shadow status → Display current state (existing)
- shadow analyze → NEW - Compute AST diffs + impact analysis

Technical Implementation:
- Rust AST parser using regex-based approach for prototype
- Dependency graph with BFS traversal for impact analysis
- Python observer with heuristic rules and risk scoring
- WASM bridge with comprehensive fallback implementations
- TypeScript CLI with structured JSON output

Build Process:
1. npm install (install Node.js dependencies)
2. npm run build (compile TypeScript + Rust WASM + run tests)
3. node dist/cli/main.js analyze (run analysis)

Demo Flow:
1. shadow init
2. shadow start  
3. Create/edit TypeScript files in .shadow/
4. shadow analyze → Returns AST diffs + impact analysis
5. shadow stop

Status: READY FOR BLOCK III - THE CLOUD BRIDGE

All Block II requirements implemented with:
- AST-aware diff tracking for JS/TS
- Dependency graphing with impact analysis  
- Passive AI Observer with pause detection
- CLI analyze command with JSON output
- Comprehensive fallback implementations
- Unit tests and demonstration scripts
